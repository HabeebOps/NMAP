## Project Overview:

This project enables the creation of a straightforward network scanner accessible via a web browser on the network.

Essentially, this project utilizes a Cron Job every 10 minutes to trigger nmap for scanning our network and outputs the results into a text file. Then, a PHP file is used to format the text file, add a few enhancements, and present the results for a web browser.
